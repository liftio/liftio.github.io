        <p>The simplest possible laptop stand, promoting great posture, more comfortable working and better productivity. It takes up virtually no extra space in your bag so you can work well from anywhere.</p>

        <p><b>Versatile:</b> suitable for 13" to 15" laptops, with an 11" version coming soon</p>
        <p><b>Portable:</b> when disassembled it's just 3mm thick and weighs less than 200g</p>
        <p><b>Ergonomic:</b> lifts your laptop screen to reduce neck, back and shoulder strain</p>

        <p>A laptop on its own is an ergonomic nightmare because the screen is at the same height as the keyboard. Liftio is designed to be used with a seperate keyboard and mouse. This lets you keep your arms and wrists in a comfortable, natural position while not forcing you to look down at the screen.</p>
